## Overview
This is a multiplayer mod (called a "plugin") for the popular video game **Minecraft**. This mod allows you to save, view, and even share with your friends your favorite locations within the game. It does this all with a sleek user interface that is very responsive and easy to use.

## Why
The game is **massive** - each world can be up to 60 million meters wide which is about **five times the diameter of the earth**. As such, it can be difficult to keep track of your favorite locations. 

The **traditional** method of saving these locations is to:
1. Press "f2" to pull up the in-game debug menu (yes, the menu used for developers)
2. Locate the displayed player coordinates
3. Note these coordinates down somewhere *Don't forget to save that notepad document... and put it in a place you won't forget it... good luck*

Not only does this take you away from the game by "breaking the fourth wall" of your game time, it also is just a lot of work, and I am lazy; I had to automate it.

## Limitations
There are a lot of limitations in making multiplayer plugins for the vanilla Minecraft client and server experience. Multiplayer plugins are **not allowed to add any new content to the game**. You are only permitted to **modify what already exists**. As such, plugin creators like myself have to get creative in order to make an experience using only existing assets.
